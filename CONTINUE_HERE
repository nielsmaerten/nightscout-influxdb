- I'm busy creating types for the different Nightscout treatments
  in ns-to-influxdb.ts

- eventType is not really usable because of Nightscout's unsafe types.
- Just checking whether a document has fiels like 'carbs' or 'insulin'
  may be better.

- Let's first try to get boluses and carbs into the Influxdb.
- Then we can start looking at basal rates, exercise, etc.
